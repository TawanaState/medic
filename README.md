## 🤔 What is This?

A fun experiment in medical diagnosis using AI! This web app lets you input symptoms and uses a deep learning model to suggest possible conditions. Think of it as a high-tech medical dictionary - definitely **not** a replacement for real doctors! (a part of me wants to build this though)

## ⚕️ How it Works

1. Select your symptoms from a comprehensive list
2. Our AI model (with 4,2 Million parameters!) processes them
3. Get a list of possible conditions with confidence scores
4. Remember: This is for educational purposes only!

## 🔬 The Tech Behind It

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow.js (converted from Python)
- **Performance**: ~85% accuracy on test data
- **Dataset**: Large collection of symptom-disease mappings
- **Architecture**: Dense Neural Network with multiple layers

## 🚀 Try It Yourself

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tawanastate/medic.git

# Install dependencies
cd medic
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

I'm a software developer, not a medical professional! This project is:
- ✅ An interesting tech experiment
- ✅ Open source and free to use
- ✅ Educational
- ❌ NOT a substitute for professional medical advice
- ❌ NOT meant for self-diagnosis

## 🤝 Let's Make It Better!

Are you a healthcare professional interested in improving this project? I'd love to collaborate! While I can handle the tech side, having medical expertise would make this tool much more valuable.
